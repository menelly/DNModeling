# 🧹 DNModeling Housekeeping Summary
**Date:** September 27, 2024  
**Performed by:** Ace & Ren  
**Purpose:** Clean up and organize the DNModeling codebase for better maintainability

## 🎯 Goals Accomplished

### ✅ Archived One-Off Analysis Scripts
**Moved to:** `archive/analysis_scripts/`

- `analyze_gly_cys_improvements.py` - Glycine/cysteine improvement analysis
- `analyze_proline_direction.py` - Proline substitution direction analysis
- `clinvar_quality_checker.py` - ClinVar data quality assessment
- `cross_family_pattern_analyzer.py` - Cross-family pattern detection
- `hotspot_disagreement_analyzer.py` - Hotspot disagreement analysis
- `simple_quality_analyzer.py` - Simple quality assessment tool

### ✅ Archived Experimental Scripts  
**Moved to:** `archive/experimental_scripts/`
- `cleanup_repo.py` - Repository cleanup utility
- `organize_learning_files.py` - Learning file organization tool
- `test_nova_genes.py` - Nova gene testing script
- `cache_gene_contexts.py` - Gene context caching utility

### ✅ Archived Old Results
**Moved to:** `archive/old_results/`
- All `*results*.tsv` and `*results*.csv` files
- `batch_log.txt` - Historical batch processing logs
- `disagreements_only.tsv` - Disagreement-only analysis results
- Personal result files (`ren_*.csv`, `ren_*.tsv`)
- Gene-specific result files (`col7a1_*.csv`, `MYO7A_*.tsv`, `RYR1-*.tsv`)

### ✅ Organized Root Directory Files
**Created logical folder structure:**

#### `/core_analyzers/` - Main Analysis Components
- `plausibility_filter.py` - Gene family-aware biological filtering system
- `functional_domain_weighter.py` - Domain-specific impact scoring
- `motif_detector.py` - Protein motif pattern detection
- `collagen_scanner.py` - Collagen-specific analysis tools

#### `/data_processing/` - Data Handling Utilities  
- `clinvar_inheritance_cache.py` - ClinVar inheritance pattern caching
- `sequence_mismatch_handler.py` - Sequence alignment and mismatch handling
- `universal_protein_annotator.py` - Comprehensive protein annotation system

#### `/ml_training/` - Machine Learning Training
- `train_families.py` - Family-specific ML model training orchestrator

#### `/config/` - Configuration & Cache Files
- `category_keywords.json` - Gene family classification keywords
- `rsid_frequency_cache.json` - Cached variant frequency data

### ✅ Cleaned Up Cache Files
- Removed all `__pycache__/` directories and outdated bytecode
- Cleaned up stale Python cache files throughout the codebase

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before Housekeeping:
```
DNModeling/
├── 15+ analysis scripts scattered in root
├── 10+ result files scattered in root  
├── 4+ experimental scripts in root
├── Multiple __pycache__ directories
├── Mixed configuration files
└── Generally cluttered structure
```

### After Housekeeping:
```
DNModeling/
├── archive/
│   ├── analysis_scripts/     (8 files)
│   ├── experimental_scripts/ (4 files)
│   └── old_results/         (15+ files)
├── core_analyzers/          (4 files)
├── data_processing/         (3 files)
├── ml_training/             (1 file)
├── config/                  (2 files)
├── analyzers/               (existing)
├── cascade/                 (existing)
├── nova_dn/                 (existing)
├── utils/                   (existing)
├── docs/                    (existing)
├── learning/                (existing)
├── tests/                   (existing)
└── Clean root directory!
```

## 🎉 Benefits Achieved

### 🔍 **Improved Discoverability**
- Core analysis components clearly separated from utilities
- Experimental/one-off scripts archived but preserved
- Logical grouping makes finding relevant code much easier

### 🧹 **Reduced Clutter**
- Root directory now contains only essential folders and files
- Historical results preserved but out of the way
- No more confusion about which scripts are actively used

### 🚀 **Better Maintainability**
- Clear separation of concerns between different types of code
- Easier to identify what needs updating vs what's archived
- New developers can understand the structure immediately

### 📚 **Enhanced Documentation**
- Updated CODEBASE_ROADMAP.md to reflect new structure
- Added housekeeping summary for future reference
- Clear documentation of what was moved where

## 🔮 Future Maintenance

### Recommended Practices:
1. **Keep root directory clean** - new scripts should go in appropriate folders
2. **Archive completed experiments** - move one-off analysis scripts to archive when done
3. **Update roadmap** - keep documentation current when adding new components
4. **Regular cleanup** - periodic housekeeping to prevent accumulation of clutter

### Folder Guidelines:
- `core_analyzers/` - Reusable analysis components used by multiple systems
- `data_processing/` - Utilities for handling, caching, and processing data
- `ml_training/` - Scripts specifically for training machine learning models
- `config/` - Configuration files, caches, and static data
- `archive/` - Completed experiments, old results, deprecated code

## 📝 Notes

- **No functionality was lost** - all files were moved, not deleted
- **Import paths may need updating** - some scripts may need path adjustments
- **Archive is searchable** - old analysis scripts can still be referenced
- **Structure is scalable** - new components can be added to appropriate folders

---

**Housekeeping completed successfully! The DNModeling codebase is now much more organized and maintainable.** 🎉
